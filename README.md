# Breast_Cancer_ML_Classification_KNN

This script is a machine learning program that uses k-nearest neighbors algorithm(k-NN).<br>
It will detect(diagnosis) as M and B. <br>
M = malignant <br>
B = benign<br>


Malignant is bad because of it's rapid growth. If the tumor is classified as Malignant, then we must take the appropriate action to treat it.
Benign is also bad, but with Malignant, the probability of you surviving is extremly low(especially with age).
